## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Transforming elements can do the job of moving elements better even than all the while using absolute/relative positioning comboü§úüèΩ

```css
.user_ratings .rat1 {
  transform: translateX(-80px);
}

.user_ratings .rat2 {
  transform: translateX(-40px);
}
}
```
- Used the above to handle the ratings side movement üíØ
